### Design Decisions
* Our aim was to choose a UI design that is straightforward and basic in order to emphasize the functionality.
* We opted to use Django as our backend technology because it is a web framework based on Python that allowed us to build websites that rely on databases, and also offers strong assistance for developing REST APIs.
* The Django REST framework (DRF) is a versatile and has robust set of tools for constructing Web APIs, and its primary advantage is that it simplifies the serialization process.
* We opted to use ReactJs as our frontend technology as ReactJS boasts a modular architecture that facilitates easy development, management, updating, and scaling of applications. It's well-defined structure also simplifies testing and debugging. Additionally, UI components can be deconstructed and reused.
* We hosted our Application on Cloud using AWS as Cloud Provider.
* We Deployed our Application on Amazon EC2 as it offers a highly reliable environment.
* We used Application Load Balancers, to distribute Web traffic among EC2 instances.
* We installed SSL/TLS certificates to our load balancers for secure communications.
* We hosted our Database on Amazon RDS. We chose PostGreSQL because we wanted to enforce the relationships between entities and as most of the data was structured.
